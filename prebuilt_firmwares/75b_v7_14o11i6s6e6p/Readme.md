Configuration for a colorlight 5a75b V7.0 with
- 14 outputs
- 11 inputs
- 6 stepgens
- 6 encoders
- 6 pwm generators
- ip address 192.168.2.50 port 1234 MAC 0x10e2d5000000
- build command: ./Lcnc_75b_v7_14o11i6s6e6p.py --board=5a-75b --revision=7.0 --eth-ip=192.168.2.50 --eth-port=1234 --mac-address=0x10e2d5000000 --build --doc
- if you want to try dual board configuration use Lcnc_75b_v7_14o11i6s6e6p_1.bit for the second board, it was built with the following options in order to use it as second board
    - ip address 192.168.2.51 port 1235 MAC 0x10e2d5000001
    - build command: ./Lcnc_75b_v7_14o11i6s6e6p.py --board=5a-75b --revision=7.0 --eth-ip=192.168.2.51 --eth-port=1235 --mac-address=0x10e2d5000001 --build --doc
- if you rebuild with your options, the bit file will be located in /build/colorlight_5a_75b/gateware
- pinout can be found in file Lcnc_configurations_pinout.ods
- reset port (to be held to zero): J8 pin 7 (starting to count from pin 1)
- load the bitfile to fpga with openFPGAloader in oss-cad-suite: ~/oss-cad-suite/bin/openFPGALoader --unprotect-flash -c ft232 -f ./Lcnc_75b_v7_14o11i6s6e6p.bit
